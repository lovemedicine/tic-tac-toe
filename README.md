# (tic tac toe)

A command line game: play tic tac toe against a dumb bot! My first program written in clojure :)

## How to use

1. If you have [Leningen](https://leiningen.org) installed:

```
git clone https://github.com/lovemedicine/tic-tac-toe.git
cd tic-tac-toe
lein run
```

2. Otherwise, if you have Java installed, you can clone the repo and run the uberjar:

```
git clone https://github.com/lovemedicine/tic-tac-toe.git
java -jar jar/tic-tac-toe.jar
```
